The headlights lit up a small portion of the road ahead. Looking out of the window was pointless, there was no light, no horizon, and no nothing; there was only the dark abyss. The Dhaka-Sylhet highway N2 was a surreal road to take at night. On 23rd of November, My uncle, cousin and I planned a thousand kilometers roundtrip to Sylhet and started for the destination at 3 PM. By the time we left Dhaka, the sun had set and we were speeding through the rustic roads of the more undeveloped parts of Bangladesh.

The N2 highway was a scary experience at first. The two way road had no discernible divider other than the white painting on the road and as we headed to the north-east trajectory, the road became incredibly narrower. A wide range of vehicles starting from tiny 3 wheeled CNG automobiles to 18 wheeler mega-lorries trasversed the road on both directions. Overtaking on these narrow roads were rampant, and the wind blow from the other side felt near deadly. For the first 100 kilometers, I just grabbed on to my seat out of sheer terror as the headlights from the oncoming overtaking vehicles shone brightly on my face.

The frightening journey continued for three and half hours, as we passed through the cities of Narayanganj, Vairab and Brahmanbaria to the industrial city of Habiganj. There the roads became considerably wider and the divider became more obvious. I was happy to be back into civilization. We passed the factories of Star Ceramics, RAK Paints, Pran Industries and more. But boy, was I naïve. The frightening journey did not end there, but it was yet to begin.

As we headed towards Moulavibazar from Habiganj, the roads became narrower again, this time much narrower than I have previously experienced. The size of the trucks and lorries on the other side increased as well as their velocity, and the overtaking tendencies seemed to grow exponentially. I grabbed on to my seat harder than before. The high-beams from the oncoming vehicles kept painting the interior of the car with momentary fringes. At last we crossed Moulavibazar and kept on heading towards the Sylhet City, our destination point. The journey from Habiganj to the Sylhet city took another three hours.

The City of Sylhet is a neat little place, comprising of low-rise building and a clean environment. Yes, there are dirt and filth everywhere, like the rest of Bangladesh, but the amount was incredibly low, as low as to easily overlook. There were couple of great hotels in the main strip of the city. As we troddled along the city, it was bustling with life around us.

Finally we arrived at my uncle’s official residence in Khadimnagar. It was a nice villa on top of a small mountain. There were three bedrooms with a dining/living space on the first floor. It was time for us to unwind, unpack and get settled in. Dinner was served and it tasted amazing after a seven and half hours journey through – what seemed like the deadliest road in the world.

I woke up early the next morning, now I could see through the window of my room. Sylhet was amazing aesthetically, even from my window, although I couldn’t see much. I went out to the balcony, the view of the twisted road that leads to the main road was mesmerizing. It was cold outside, but I lingered on. I lit up a cigarette and tried to take it all in. Then one by one, everyone woke up and breakfast was served.

At 9 AM my cousin and I started out to visit some of the tourist attractions of the city. Our first stop was a gas station, well to fill up our tank, nothing fancy there. Some beggars approached us, and we praised their early rising zen habits Haha. Then we went to Hazrat Shahjalal Sanctuary, a religious place in Sylhet. The place was impeccably kept and there were a pigeon sanctuary and a fish pond. Although we needed to take of our shoes to enter the holiest parts of the establishment, it was a great experience nonetheless. Photography was prohibited in those parts as well.

Next stop, Keane Bridge and the Sylhet Circuit House. I did not get the hype around the Keane Bridge, apart from the part it’s called the gateway to the Sylhet City and it being extremely narrow for a gateway to a city. Like all other bridges, it’s built with steel and concrete. Anyways, the Sylhet Circuit House was nearby and we went there. It was a beautiful building with a western architecture and predominantly houses leaders from various countries on visit.

While still musing about the fuss of the Keane Bridge, we reached MAG Osmani Medical College, there my cousin and I roamed through the halls observing keen undergraduate medical students learning in classrooms and laboratories. The visit was short, but we enjoyed it. After this we visited another sanctuary of another nameless holy person where monkeys resided. I noticed around a dozen monkeys on the walls and four or five goats wandering the streets. Nearby, there were a couple of shops selling bananas. The shopkeepers warned us to not hold the bananas in our hands for too long, as that will encourage the monkeys to snatch the bananas from our hands, which in turn can cause injury to us. All hell broke loose as soon as we started tossing the bananas to the monkeys. The goats became mobile, chasing the bananas thrown to the monkeys. The number of monkeys became fifty from a mere dozen, with goats running around our legs and towards the projectile bananas. One monkey got into our car through an open window and stole a half consumed tamarind chutney. Chaos was everywhere, so was the laughter. People, goats and monkeys were running everywhere. After our banana reserve emptied, we just got inside our car and speeded away from the place as far as possible.

Next stop, uncle’s office. Jalalabad Gas T&D System’s head office is located in Mendibag, Sylhet. The building is huge and seems a little out of place in the city which is mainly comprised of low-rise, low-profile buildings. Uncle’s colleagues gave us a tour of the building, which has multiple meeting rooms, planning rooms and a 467 seat auditorium. Uncle’s suite in the building comprised of five rooms. After having light refreshment we planned to go to Jaflong, the border town of Sylhet.

Jaflong was an hour long drive from the city. It was once a dreamy excursion point, with small hills and abundance of greenery and blue water, but industrialization and mining for natural goods have turned the place into a bleak-barren flatland. There were tons of trucks full of stones moving around, and there was dust everywhere. We reached the tourist spot in Jaflong, a place from where you can see the river flowing and India on the other side. There was not much else to see other than a plethora of small shops on the riverside. We bargained for the locally made bedsheets and warmers, made a few purchases and watched the sunset. After the sunset, we kept on standing, looking into the darkness towards the small Indian towns on the other side of the border, thinking of the lives of men there, and musing whether they too are looking at our side of the border and they too are thinking about our lives.

We headed back to the rest house in Sylhet City. Dinner was served, we talked about our day, watched a little TV and we went to bed.

Next morning, we woke up early in the morning. For the breakfast, a local traditional dish was served. It was called “Aakhni”, a tasty biriyani like dish prepared with beef. It was so good. After the delicious round of breakfast extravaganza, we started out for Day Two in Sylhet City.

We could not decide on what to see in our limited time, as we were set to come back to Dhaka later that very day. We slashed the ideas to visit Madhobkunda as there was no point to visit that place in that time of the year, which is known for its waterfalls that dry up right after the rainy season.

We decided that we’ll visit some renowned tea-gardens in Sylhet. The trip wouldn’t be complete without visiting some tea gardens in the ‘Tea-Capital of Bangladesh’. First we entered the vast gardens of Ispahani Tea Gardens, owned by the Ispahani Group, one of the biggest conglomerates of Bangladesh. We visited their “Ghazipore Tea State” tea processing plant and learned about the process, took some photos and inhaled a ton of dust in our lungs. There we got invited to visit the Ispahani guest house located in the “Mirzapore Tea State” located in Kulaura.

The villa was placed on top of a medium height hill. The view while we were ascending was picturesque. On top of the hill, the house was kept in pristine condition with big rooms, generous amenities and with an unmatched view. The hill was covered with incense trees and the whole Sylhet City could be seen from that vantage point.
We were greeted by the officials and tea was served. We enjoyed the good tea along with some good company, learned a little bit about the business concerns of Ispahani Group and then we headed back for our descend journey from the hilltop.

Next stop, the tea stall that invented the seven layer tea in the picturesque town of Srimangal. The tea took fifteen minutes to prepare. I didn’t expect such a distinct range of tastes to come from the different layers of the tea. The first layer was slightly spicy, the second layer tasted like coffee, the third, fourth and fifth layer tasted like something I can’t possibly write down in words. The sixth layer was traditional milk tea, and the seventh layer was lemon tea. The experience was great.

At the tea stall, we were greeted by some senior officials from uncle’s office, who took us out for lunch. We dined in style at a restaurant called “Shoshurbari (In-laws house)”. The service was amazing with its homely touches. After lunch, we visted the vast tea-state of Finlay's tea. The estate covered some fourty thousand acres of lush green land.

We went to a flagship hotel nearby to unwind and relax. It’s called the Grand Sultan Tea Resort & Golf and has several good restaurants and a 9 hole golf course, all set in a picturesque setting.

After an hour of relaxing in the midst of serenity, it was time to get back to the harsh realities of life. We were tired and the camera battery died. We didn’t care much about the battery, the beautiful panoramas kept on flashing before our eyes as the sun set in the west. We picked up uncle in Moulavibazaar and speeded our way towards Dhaka, while silently reminiscing the wonderful memories we had during the last two days.
