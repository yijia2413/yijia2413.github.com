OH MY GOD! I am still in a trance; no, it’s more like I am still on the Martian Surface. The audiobook of **“The Martian”** by *Andy Weir* and narrated by *R.C. Bray* had taken me to a journey to Mars and left me there. Although the protagonist of the sci-fi fiction finally got to the spaceship back home, the amazing narration and storytelling never let me to escape the surreal surroundings of Mars.

I don’t want to give away any spoilers. So this post will not be a review post or anything of that sort for the book, rather I will share my experience of ten and half hours of continuous listening to the audiobook. I am sure the hardcover edition or the kindle version of **“The Martian”** is a lovely read, but my-o-my, the audiobook surely takes you out on a journey. The subtlety and the nuances in the voice of R.C. Bray immediately lifted me off from my comfortable surroundings and dumped me on the surface of Mars with the book’s protagonist **Mark Watney**. Alone, all alone on a planet, a red, rusting planet. The sense of helplessness the narrator conveyed through his storytelling felt absolutely real. It was terrifying to say the least, the sense of desolation loomed over like an unforeseen dust storm, and this is what makes the audiobook so much gratifying.

**“The Martian”** is *Andy Weir*’s first novel. I knew it would be a good read according to the reviews it received on Amazon. But I opted to go for the 10 and half hours of the audiobook on Audible instead. Reading requires an active attention, and I don’t want to commit unless I really like the author. Boy, I made a great decision. I would have never known the joy of listening to a great story first time through the voice of a great narrator if I opted out for the hardcopy of the book. The audiobook was like watching a 10 and half hours of goose bump inducing awesome thriller movie seen on a totally immersive IMAX screen with infinite resolution.

> The story is about the philosophy that ‘Life is interesting, Death is boring’

The story is about Mark Watney and the 5 others crews of Ares 3 on a planned 31 day mission to the planet Mars. As a dust storm hits, the mission gets cut short on the 6th day and on the way back to the Ascend Vehicle, Watney gets hit by a flying antenna and gets stranded on the surface of Mars. Thinking him dead, the crew leaves Mars with saddened heart and heads back for earth. Watney survives the hit and now is all alone on the God-forsaken planet. But Watney is wonderfully resourceful and he quickly plans out his survival. He rations his food reserve and kept increasing his odds of survival bit by bit, upto 400 days. His botany skills come to play when he decided to grow potatoes on Mars. Watney becomes first in many things, first ever to spend more than 31 days on the surface of Mars, first ever to grow plants on Mars, first ever to travel long distances on Mars, hell even, first ever to make a fire on Mars and get blown in the process. But the story is not about the survival tactics of Mark Watney, the story is about the philosophy that *‘Life is interesting, Death is boring’*. Andy Weir conveys that message brilliantly through this book.

If you enjoy reading through blogs, you’ll love **“The Martian”**. The book contains a few hundred logs made by Watney. Most of the storytelling is done through the “Watney” logs. Mark Watney’s sense of humor and optimistic view of life are what gives the book its edge. Through the humor, the reader gets to ride along Watney in his journey, even when the situation seems dire, and the horizon darker, the humor gives hope, hope in its most subtle form. There are no cliff-hangers in the book to encourage the reader to keep on going, the desperation, the humor and the hope it transpires, and the urge to go along a once-in-a-lifetime journey along with the protagonist are more than enough for the reader to stay glued. As Watney journey’s through the vast-rough lands of Mars alone in his custom-fitted rover, the reader can see the rims of the huge craters far away. It’s an eerie feeling, yet it’s a rewarding one.

So, the book tells the story of Mark Watney’s survival on the surface of Mars for more than a year, his hardships, his multiple encounters with death, his ingenuity, his resourcefulness, his crew members integrity and dedication, his hopes, his faith, his courage, his optimism and his humor, yet the book is more than that. **“The Martian”** reverberates the joy of life and sticks its middle finger to death. It does it through Mark Watney’s sharp humor and it and only it allows the reader to take the back seat in Mark Watney’s journey through the impossible terrain of desolation, and ascends the novel to new heights of greatness.
